# Technical spikes

# What are technical spikes?
# When and why would a spike be useful?
# How would you successfully spike on a topic?
# Give an example of how a spike could have helped with last week's projects.
At our last project we used flex box to introduce our team using four images with the name of each member below the image.
first we start building the section based on our knowledge without doing any research first but we face a problem with the responsive design before we start using flex box so after wasting some time we start searching on responsive design and how to fix the problem with our design.
Flex-Box was a new module to us so we should have spiked and did some research before we started coding and experimenting without studying Flex and its properties, using spike way would have saved us some time.
