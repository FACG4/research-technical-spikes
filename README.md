___
# How would you successfully spike on a topic?



### 1- Create a Small Test (Product Features):

* **Optimization.**
* **Features.**
* **Programming language.**


### 2- Pairing/Testing a Multitude of Approaches:

* **Testing many different approaches, and comparing the results.**
* **Share your solutions, provide recommendations.**
* **Features: More testing, more information, more insight. More capacity to generate solutions.**


* **Ecosystem: Comparing the products ecosystem.**
 * Human resource and human capital.
 * How many platforms?
 * Tools: Google Trends.


**Example:**

   Features   | environment  | Issues      | advantages      | Recommendations
   ---        |---           |---          |---              |----
   A, B, C, D |Environment A | Slow        | Easily readable | Do not use


### 3- Brief the Product's Owner.
Simple explanation of experiments and findings.
 * What we tried,
 * What we found,
 * Why we are using X, Y, Z.


# Give an example of how a spike could have helped with last week's projects.
At our last project we used flex box to introduce our team using four images with the name of each member below the image.
first we start building the section based on our knowledge without doing any research first but we face a problem with the responsive design before we start using flex box so after wasting some time we start searching on responsive design and how to fix the problem with our design.
Flex-Box was a new module to us so we should have spiked and did some research before we started coding and experimenting without studying Flex and its properties, using spike way would have saved us some time.
