# Technical spikes

# What are technical spikes?
# When and why would a spike be useful?
# How would you successfully spike on a topic?
# Give an example of how a spike could have helped with last week's projects.

## When?

* **Spikes are great for helping a team that’s working in new technologies or breaking new ground with a “green field” project to understand the Product Owner’s needs.**

* **But they can be dangerous time sinks if the team isn’t careful about putting some pretty firm guardrails on them. With the appropriate guidance and constraints, though, technical spikes are a valuable tool in any team’s toolbox.**

## Why?

* **Spikes allow us to answer questions about stories the Product Owner has asked us to do but about which we lack some critical knowledge.**

* **We’re not looking to understand everything about the problem space. We want to simply know enough to be able to ask some relevant questions about the story and get an idea of the scope of work .**
